# CS271Project1

**Introduction**
The purpose of this assignment is to acquaint you with elementary MASM programming and integer arithmetic operations (CLO 3, 4).

1. Introduction to MASM assembly language
2. Defining variables (integer and string)
3. Using library procedures for I/O
4. Integer arithmetic

**What you must do**
Program Description
Write and test a MASM program to perform the following tasks:

1. Display your name and program title on the output screen.
2. Display instructions for the user.
3. Prompt the user to enter three numbers (A, B, C) in strictly descending order.
4. Calculate the sum and differences: (A+B, A-B, A+C, A-C, B+C, B-C, A+B+C).
5. Display the results of the above calculations.
6. Display a closing message.

**Program Requirements**
1. The program must be fully documented and laid out according to the CS271 Style Guide. This includes a complete header block for identification, description, etc., and a comment outline to explain each section of code.
2. The main procedure must be divided into the following separate and distinct logical sections:
    1. introduction
    2. get the data
    3. calculate the required values
    4. display the results
    5. say goodbye
3. When displaying the results, restate the inputs in equation form (e.g. "5 + 4 = 9") rather than using placeholder letters (see the Example Execution below).
4. The results of calculations must be stored in named variables before being displayed.

**Notes**
1. You are not required to handle negative input or negative results. We will not test input that would generate a negative output or overflow.
2. Check the Course Syllabus for late submission guidelines.
3. Find the assembly language instruction syntax and help in the CS271 Instructions Reference.
4. To create, assemble, run,  and modify your program, follow the instructions on the course Syllabus Page's "Tools" tab.

**Example Execution**
User input in **boldface italics**.

         Elementary Arithmetic     by Wile E. Coyote
Enter 3 numbers A > B > C, and I'll show you the sums and differences.
First number: **20**
Second number: **10**
Third number: **5**

20 + 10 = 30
20 - 10 = 10
20 + 5 = 25
20 - 5 = 15
10 + 5 = 15
10 - 5 = 5
20 + 10 + 5 = 35

Thanks for using Elementary Arithmetic!  Goodbye!

**Extra Credit Options (Original Project Definition must be Fulfilled)**
To receive points for any extra credit options, you must add one print statement to your program output per extra credit which describes the extra credit you chose to work on. You will not receive extra credit points unless you do this. The statement must be formatted as follows...

--Program Intro--
**EC: DESCRIPTION
--Program prompts, etcâ€”

For example, for extra credit option #2, program execution would look like this:

         Elementary Arithmetic     by Wile E. Coyote
**EC: Program verifies the numbers are in descending order.

Enter 3 numbers A > B > C, and I'll show you the sums and differences.
First number: 20
Second number: 25
ERROR: The numbers are not in descending order!

Impressed?  Bye!

**Extra Credit Options**
1. Repeat until the user chooses to quit. (1pt)
2. Check if numbers are in strictly descending order. NOTE: Strictly Descending means A > B > C (1pt)
3. Handle negative results and computes B-A, C-A, C-B, C-B-A. (1pt)
4. Calculate and display the quotients A/B, A/C, B/C, printing the quotient and remainder (see DIV and IDIV instructions). Division by zero need not be properly handled. (2pt)
